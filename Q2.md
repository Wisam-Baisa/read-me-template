Arrays vs Linked Lists
1. Memory Allocation
Arrays: Arrays use contiguous memory blocks, meaning the memory for all elements is allocated together. This leads to faster access, but resizing arrays can be expensive because it requires copying data to a new block.

Linked Lists: Linked lists use non-contiguous memory, where each element (node) points to the next. Memory allocation happens dynamically as elements are added or removed.

2. Performance
Arrays: Accessing elements in arrays is O(1) because elements are stored in contiguous memory, and their position can be calculated directly.

Linked Lists: Accessing an element is O(n) because you must traverse the list from the beginning to find the element.

3. Insertion and Deletion Operations
Arrays: Insertion and deletion in arrays are O(n) because shifting elements is often necessary when adding or removing an element.

Linked Lists: Insertion and deletion can be O(1) if you have a reference to the node being inserted or deleted. However, if you need to find the node first, it will take O(n).
